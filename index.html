        <h2>Monte Carlo method's explanation</h2>
        <p>Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. The name comes from the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, where the primary developer of the method, mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam, was inspired by his uncle's gambling habits.</p>
